# rc-meal-credit-bot
A Telegram Bot that calculates and tells you whether you've been overspending or underspending your meal credits, and helps you liaise with potential buyers and sellers of credits.
The bot is equipped with a list of commands that can be viewed using the /help command. 

The /breakfast command followed by the number of breakfast credits you have remaining calculates if, at a particular point in time, you have a surplus of credits to last you the remaining semester or a deficit. The /dinner command achieves the same but with the dinner credits. 

The /buy and /sell commands followed by the price at which the user is willing to buy or sell their credits. 


Our future updates will focus on making a distinction between buying and selling breakfast and dinner credits. 

The bot can be accessed @mealcreditbot on Telegram
